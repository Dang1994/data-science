# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Introduction
Breast Cancer Prediction is a classification task aimed at predicting the diagnosis of a breast mass as either malignant (M) or benign (B). The dataset used for this prediction consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the breast mass. These features describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, providing quantitative measurements that can be used to assess the nature of the breast mass.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following information for each instance:

1. **ID Number**: A unique identifier for each sample.
2. **Diagnosis**: The target variable indicating the diagnosis, where 'M' represents malignant and 'B' represents benign.

For each cell nucleus, ten real-valued features are computed, which include:

1. **Radius**: The mean distance from the center to points on the perimeter of the nucleus.
2. **Texture**: The standard deviation of gray-scale values in the nucleus.
3. **Perimeter**: The perimeter of the nucleus.
4. **Area**: The area of the nucleus.
5. **Smoothness**: A measure of local variation in radius lengths.
6. **Compactness**: Computed as the square of the perimeter divided by the area minus 1.0.
7. **Concavity**: Describes the severity of concave portions of the nucleus contour.
8. **Concave Points**: Represents the number of concave portions of the nucleus contour.
9. **Symmetry**: Measures the symmetry of the nucleus.
10. **Fractal Dimension**: Approximates the "coastline" of the nucleus using fractal geometry.

These features provide a comprehensive set of measurements to distinguish between malignant and benign breast masses.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Use **Power BI** to analyze and visualize the dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, normalize/standardize features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate several machine learning classification models to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer.
4. **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

  - Identify key insights and trends in the data.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Tasks**:
  - Handle missing values (if any) using imputation techniques.
  - Normalize or standardize the features to ensure consistent scaling.
  - Encode the target variable (diagnosis) into numerical values (e.g., 0 for benign and 1 for malignant).
  - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Development
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification.
  - **Decision Trees**: To capture non-linear relationships in the data.
  - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: To find the optimal hyperplane for classification.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A distance-based classification algorithm.
  - **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**: To enhance predictive performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

### 4. Model Comparison
- Compare the performance of all models based on evaluation metrics.
- Select the best-performing model for final predictions.
